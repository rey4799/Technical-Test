# Technical-Test

## Description

This repository contains solutions for a technical test, including:

1. **Q1. Programming**: A dice game implemented in JavaScript. Multiple players take turns to roll dice, with the game mechanics determined by the roll results.

2. **Q2. Basic Logic**: A simple JavaScript/TypeScript program that creates a right-angled triangle using hashes (#). The size of the triangle (i.e., the number of rows) is determined by the argument passed to the `createTriangle` function.

3. **Q3. Slicing**: A simple HTML page.

## Prerequisites
